The files in this examples folder are meant for x86 and RP2xxx (using Pico SDK) platforms with
the exception of _examples_formatter.conf_ (which is used by our Arduino CI workflow to check
the Arduino examples' code format is consistent with Arduino IDE's "Artistic Style" formatter).

The subdirectories in this examples folder are strictly meant for the Arduino IDE.
